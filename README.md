# Matrix Processor


## What is this
It's a Csound realtime effect processor meant to be used in Csound For Android.


## Usage
Before launching it with Csound For Android:
1. be sure that folder structure (relative paths from file mat_proc_tpz.csd) is preserved.
2. change the --omacro:GSCURDIR=/absolute/path/to/file/mat_proc_tpz/dot/csd/ in CsOptions
3. change the --env:INCRIR+=/absolute/path/to/include/directory in CsOptions

* [Oeyvind Brandtsegg](http://oeyvind.teks.no): the code of the compressor effect
* [Per Boysen](http://www.perboysen.com): for having and sharing the idea of the [Steppophonic Looperformer](http://www.perboysen.com/steppophonic-looperformer-please-steal-this/)
